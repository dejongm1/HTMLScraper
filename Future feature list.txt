	- output folder
	- arg files
	- script to accept simple run com and args and route to java -jar ....
script to open cmd prompt and cd to jar location
	-add jar location to PATH?
shortcut to output on desktop

getRecords()
	Read in spreadsheet at start of scrape to skip records

    sort in spreadsheet. That will make it easier to find already parsed records later on

	On failed getHtmlAsDoc(baseDoc) getHtmlAsDoc(resultsPage), retry 3 times with different user-agent
	On failed getHtmlAsDoc(recordDetail) retry once, keeping track of failed pages
		- save to list or retry immediately?
	After so many failed getHtmlAsDoc()s stop trying

	Sleep even on failed connection
	
	Send e-mail when finished
		- store addresses and details in props
		- maybe separate e-mail.properties
	
	Don't override spreadsheet each run
	One sheet per state, one book per app execution
	
	Only save to spreadsheet if it's not found already
		- running every week will stop if we reach previous records
		- need to save spreadsheet if we do it this way
	
	Start where we left off? Not sure how I would do that
		- keep track of the page we're on? we would only retry a certain number of records
		- output more info per record to spreadsheet. Read the spreadsheet in first, then start there
		
	Keep properties file separate from jar?
		-use it to tweak things like site(s), columns to export/exclude, flags, etc
	

Exclude special characters (and numbers?)
Add help documentation
Result exclusion file for frequent words
	- flag for excluding common words (the, a, and, of, in, etc)
	- flag for including numbers
	- add to/remove from list
