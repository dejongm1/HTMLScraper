	Read in spreadsheet at start of scrape to skip records

    sort in spreadsheet. That will make it easier to find already parsed records later on

	On failed getHtmlAsDoc(baseDoc) getHtmlAsDoc(resultsPage), retry 3 times with different user-agent
	On failed getHtmlAsDoc(recordDetail) retry once, keeping track of failed pages
		- save to list or retry immediately?
	After so many failed getHtmlAsDoc()s stop trying
	
	Send e-mail when finished
		- store addresses and details in props
		- maybe separate e-mail.properties
	
	Don't override spreadsheet each run
	One sheet per state, one book per app execution
	
	Only save to spreadsheet if it's not found already
		- running every week will stop if we reach previous records
		- need to save spreadsheet if we do it this way
	
	Start where we left off? Not sure how I would do that
		- keep track of the page we're on? we would only retry a certain number of records
		- output more info per record to spreadsheet. Read the spreadsheet in first, then start there
		
	Keep properties file separate from jar?
		-use it to tweak things like site(s), columns to export/exclude, flags, etc
